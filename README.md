# AOSD
Advanced Operating System Design Project - It compares two algorithms and 

The idea of this project to extracting the system vs. user-level information of the running programs and use them to compare the efficiency of two algorithms.
The user-level information should include the running time (from the program starts to when it ends)

The system-level information should include:
1) CPU usage
2) Memory usage
3) Hard drive usage
4) RSS: Resident set size: This is non-swapped physical memory that a process had used
5) VMS: Virtual memory size: This is the total virtual memory used by the process
6) Number of page faults
